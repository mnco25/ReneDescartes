                <h2>What does "I think, therefore I am" mean?</h2>
                <p>René Descartes, a famous philosopher, came up with the idea "I think, therefore I am" to prove that
                    if we are thinking, we must be alive. He wanted to show that even if we doubt everything else in the
                    world, the fact that we are thinking means we definitely exist. This was a big deal because it gave
                    him a way to be sure of something, even in the face of uncertainty.</p>
                <p class="quote">Descartes was trying to find something that could be completely certain. He thought that if he could
                    doubt everything else, he needed one clear truth that couldn’t be questioned. By proving that
                    thinking itself shows that we exist, he found this unshakable truth.</p>
                <p>This idea became a cornerstone of modern philosophy. It helped Descartes and other thinkers build new
                    ways of understanding the world. Instead of just accepting things as true without question, they
                    used this certainty to explore other ideas and knowledge.</p>
                <p class="quote">Descartes used his method of doubt to get to this basic truth. By doubting everything he could, he
                    wanted to find something that was so clear that it couldn’t be doubted. Discovering that thinking
                    proves existence was his breakthrough, allowing him to confidently start rebuilding knowledge.</p>
                <p>This principle has had a lasting impact on philosophy. It changed how people think about what is true
                    and how to find certainty. Even today, the idea that thinking proves our existence is a key concept
                    in understanding the world and our place in it.</p>
